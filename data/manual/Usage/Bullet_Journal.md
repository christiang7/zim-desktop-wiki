====== Bullet Journal ======

The [[https://bulletjournal.com/|Bullet Journal Method]] was created as a pen & paper toolbox for rapidly logging whats going on day to day as well as organizing days, moths, years  and projects into meaningful documents. It is a specific way of keeping a [[Daily Journal]].

It's strongly recommended to read the [[https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn|basic intro]] online before continuing.


===== Daily logging =====
The easiest way to manage daily logs is to just use the calendar plugin

Tasks for a day can be managed using task bullets to signify
[ ] not yet done
[*] done
[x] canceled (on paper this line would be crossed with a straight line)
[>] migrated to the next day
[<] migrated to future logs

===== Weekly Planning =====
There are multiple options to handle Weekly Planning in Zim
* using a Weekly Journal to begin with
* creating a subpage under one of the weekdays to write it down there
* creating the tasks in the wiki pages of each weekday to begin with

===== Monthly Planning =====
Monthly Panning is best done shortly before the last day of the month.
Its a good opportinity to migrate tasks to the next month or future log as well as migrating tasks from the future log to then next months.


===== Future Log =====
The future logs is best created as subpage of each yearas in the bullet journal method it gets migrated every time a new Journal Book is started.
Anectodal evidence says its common to use 2-3 Jurnal books per year so migrating the future log at least once per year helps to rearrache/repriorize the items in that log.
